本页面罗列了一些易混淆和难懂的概念。

## 正版　盗版
《现代汉语词典》第7版对正版的解释是：
> 出版单位正式出版的版本（对“盗版”而言）
对盗版的解释是：
> 未经版权所有者同意而偷印或偷录的版本
因此（给他们下个准确定义）
Minecraft 最终用户许可协议（EULA）中写道：
> The one major rule is that you must not distribute anything we've made unless we specifically agree to it. By "distribute anything we've made" what we mean is:
>
> - give copies of our Game to anyone else;
> - make commercial use of anything we've made;
> - try to make money from anything we've made; or
> - let other people get access to anything we've made in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;
>
> unless we specifically agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear, "the Game" or "what we have made" includes, but is not limited to, the client or the server software for our Game and includes Minecraft and Minecraft: Java Edition on all platforms. It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified versions of a Game, part of those things, or anything else we've made.
因此，分发基岩版的任何版本（包括基岩版专用服务器）都违反EULA，属于盗版行为。
